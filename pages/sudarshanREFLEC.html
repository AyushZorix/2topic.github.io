    <h1>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>1. Problem Solving in Nature</h2>
            <p>Nature has inspired many algorithms. Some common approaches are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> This technique breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, like calculating Fibonacci numbers or finding paths in a maze.</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Uses loops to perform repetitive tasks, such as calculating a factorial or iterating through a list of numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> This method explores all possible solutions, eliminating those that don’t work. Classic problems include the N-Queens problem and Towers of Hanoi.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Efficiency of Algorithms</h2>
            <p>When designing algorithms, efficiency is a major concern, especially when working with large data sets. The two main factors to evaluate are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> This tells us how quickly an algorithm completes its task.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> This refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Algorithm Design Principles</h2>
            <p>To create efficient algorithms, some basic strategies are used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> A problem is broken into smaller subproblems, which are solved independently. Merge Sort is an example of this approach.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> It avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results and reusing them.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Here, we try all possibilities by building partial solutions, and we discard the ones that don’t work.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Trees and Hierarchical Data Structures</h2>
            <p>In many applications, data is best represented as a tree. Some popular tree structures are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A tree where each node has at most two children. It helps with efficient searching, inserting, and deleting.</li>
                <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A balanced binary search tree that keeps the height logarithmic to ensure fast operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A self-balancing tree used for faster searching and updating.</li>
                <li><strong>Trie:</strong> A tree that stores strings, making it ideal for tasks like autocomplete.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Efficient Array Query Algorithms</h2>
            <p>To handle arrays more efficiently, some algorithms help with fast queries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sparse Table:</strong> Allows constant time queries (like range minimum or maximum) after O(n log n) preprocessing.</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Trees:</strong> Handle range queries efficiently, such as sum or maximum over a segment of the array.</li>
                <li><strong>Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees):</strong> Useful for cumulative frequency calculations, like in statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Look-Up Table:</strong> Stores precomputed results to save time during repeated calculations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Trees vs. Graphs</h2>
            <p>Both trees and graphs are used to represent relationships but in different ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trees:</strong> These are a special kind of graph with no cycles. They are used in applications like file systems and decision trees.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> More general, they can have cycles and are used in networks, routing problems, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> A traversal method that explores each branch of the tree or graph as deep as possible before backtracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> A traversal method that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Sorting and searching are essential operations for many algorithms. Some key methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort.</li>
                <li><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong> Linear Search, Binary Search, DFS, and BFS.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Importance of Graph Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Graph algorithms are widely used in fields like networking and optimization. Some important algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traversal Algorithms:</strong> DFS and BFS are the basic ways to explore nodes in a graph.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortest Path Algorithms:</strong> Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms are used to find the shortest path between nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Spanning Tree Algorithms:</strong> Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are used to find a minimum spanning tree, which connects all nodes with the least total weight.</li>
            </ul>
